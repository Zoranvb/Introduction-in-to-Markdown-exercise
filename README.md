# Zoran Van Bellegem (Aspiring Junior Developer)

## Who am I?

<p>I'm a 41y/old aspiring Junior Developer who lives in Nazareth, Belgium. I discovered programming pretty late in my life. I had an introduction to Python at the University of Brussels and it stuck with me. I liked it a lot and wanted to do more with it. Now I'm following 'Python Developer' in evening school (Syntra; I just finished my first year of two) and the fulltime course 'Junior Developer' (BeCode).
</p>

## My three most surprising skills:
<p>1. I'm getting pretty good at making music. I play bass guitar, piano and drums, but my real passion is guitars. I have my own band that I write the music for. <br>
2. I have a lot of experience in working in warehouses, so i have developed the skill to make everything run more efficient.<br>
3. I'm pretty good at Karting (though not an expert and i would be faster if i was lighter and smaller).<br>
</p>

## Three things I like the most in this universe:
<p>1. I'm a big car fan. I love watching Formula 1 as well. <br>
2. I'm a musician, so obviously i love music in general.<br>
3. I like to spend a lot of time on gaming. Some of my favorite games are Fallout, Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto (online), Mass Effect and most of the decent racing games like Gran Turismo, Assetto Corsa (Competizione).
</p>

## The Objectives i want to achieve as a developer during BeCode:
<p> 1. Become more confident in my coding. <br>
2. This is an obvious one: I would love to pass this course to make a living off of this.
</p>

## Fears i might have:
<p>The biggest fear i have in this course is failing. That i will realise I don't have what it takes to become a developer.</p>

## Things I'm looking forward to:
<p> Developing myself as a developer. Learning new things and ways to complete tasks and code.
</p>

## The three things I Value the most in working as a team:
<p>1. Meeting new people: this comes with hearing things from another perspective and it works eyeopening. <br>
2. Learning from eachother. <br>
3. Use each others strenghts to complete tasks</p>
